If not, you will need to add the component as a module to your application. Add the entry 'Zend\\Mvc\\Plugin\\Identity' to your list of modules in your application configuration (typically one of config/application.config.php or config/modules.config.php ). Usage The Identity plugin allows retrieving the identity from the AuthenticationService . For the Identity plugin to work, a Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService or Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationServiceInterface name or alias must be defined and recognized by the ServiceManager . Identity returns the identity in the AuthenticationService or null if no identity is available. As an example: public function testAction() { if ($user = $this->identity()) { // someone is logged ! } else { // not logged in } } When invoked, the Identity plugin will look for a service by the name or alias Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService in the ServiceManager . You can provide this service to the ServiceManager in a configuration file: // In a configuration file... use Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService; return [ 'service_manager' => [ 'aliases' => [ AuthenticationService::class => 'my_auth_service', ], 'invokables' => [ 'my_auth_service' => AuthenticationService::class, ], ], ]; If such service is not found, the plugin will look for a service named Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationServiceInterface in the ServiceManager . For example: use Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationServiceInterface; return [ 'service_manager' => [ 'factories' => [ AuthenticationServiceInterface::class => MyAuthenticationServiceFactory::class, ], ], ]; The Identity plugin exposes two methods: setAuthenticationService(AuthenticationServiceInterface $authenticationService) : void : Sets the authentication service instance to be used by the plugin. getAuthenticationService() : AuthenticationServiceInterface : Retrieves the current authentication service instance if any is attached.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation","text":"Install via composer: $ composer require zendframework/zend-mvc-plugin-identity If you are using the zend-component-installer , you're done!
